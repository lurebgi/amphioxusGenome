## Genome assembly
In this study we generated four haploid genome assemblies derived from two interspeicifc hybrids. The scripts can be found in [Assembly]. The details of the methods are avaiable in the supplementary methods.


## Genome annotation
We used RNA-seq (short read) and Iso-Seq (long read) to annotate the transcripts. Together with the protein sequences of the published amphioxus genomes, we annotated the coding genes in the amphixous genomes produced in this study. The scripts are availabe in [Annotation].
